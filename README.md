# Vitrina - Our HUJI Hackathon 2021 Development
During 2020, almost 85K small and medium businesses in Israel closed due to financial dificulties. We believe that the reason for that is a disconnection between the business owners and the customers - while some businesses do sell online, their customers who by from them this way don't feel a personal connection to them. We strive to flip the scrips and use technology to re-connect small business owners to their customers, while keeping their personal touch, and reaching them via shared values and beliefs. This is why we created Vitrina - an online marketplace that brings personal connection back to the front page. 

This web app was developed in 24 hours during the HUJI Hackathon 2021, and won 4th place in the competition (out of 43 groups).
